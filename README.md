# Heartbeat-Anomaly-Detection-from-ECG-Signals-in-R

## Problem Statement:
Performing statistical and exploratory data analysis on ECG data containing signals of single heartbeats and deploying multivariate predictive models to predict and classify heart arrhythmias, that is, whether the heartbeat is normal or abnormal with the highest accuracy.

## Introduction:
The heart contracts in a rhythmical manner to pump blood throughout the body with contractions beginning at the atrial sine node and propagates through the rest of the muscle. This electrical signal propagation has a pattern and because of this, electrical currents are generated on the surface of the body causing variations in the electrical potential of the skin surface. These signals can be captured with electrodes and appropriate equipment and are called ECG signals.
Thus, an ECG signal or an electrocardiogram measures the electrical activity of the heart to detect heart functioning and heart diseases. By analyzing the combination of action impulse waveforms generated by different specialized cardiac tissues in the heart, it is possible to detect some abnormality. The abnormal beating is called an arrhythmia and each type of arrhythmia is associated with a pattern that can be seen in the ECG signal.


## About the dataset:
1. The dataset consists of 12552 observations of single heartbeats.
2. The predictor vector is of length p = 187, wherein these 187 variables describe the ECG signal
impulse value at each consecutive second.
3. The diagnostic response vector Y_train is a categorical vector depicting 0 for normal heartbeat
and 1 for abnormal heartbeat.
